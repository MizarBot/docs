# Social Webhooks

:::info
Social webhooks are part of my **Social Module** and send messages when you tweet, post a video on YouTube or start streaming on Twitch.
:::

:::note
Each guild is currently limited to the following number of webhooks:
* Twitter Accounts: 50
* YouTube Channels: 50
* Twitch Channels: 50

However, this may change in the future.
:::

## Twitter
When a Twitter account is followed, the account will be checked every **2 minutes** for new tweets, retweets and replies.

They can be configured using the `!twitter` command.

## YouTube
Followed YouTube channels will send a message near-instantly when a new video is released.

They can be configured using the `!youtube` command.

## Twitch
Followed Twitch channels will send a message near-instantly when the channel starts or stops streaming.

They can be configured using the `!twitch` command.
