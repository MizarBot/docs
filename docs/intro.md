# Mizar Docs
Welcome to the Mizar Docs! This provides a centralised location where you can find information about [Mizar's](https://mizarbot.xyz) features and how to set it up.

If you're new here, you can get started by [finding how Mizar can benefit your community](./about) or reading our [setup](./getting-started/setup) guide. To install the bot to your own guild, go to [https://mizarbot.xyz/invite](https://mizarbot.xyz/invite).

By default, Mizar requests Administrator permissions as it's the simplest way to set things up. However, you can control these more granularly by reading the [required permissions](./getting-started/permissions) and clicking 'Custom Perms' when you invie the bot.
