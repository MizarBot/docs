## What Information is Stored?
For any user who logs into the website, Mizar stores:
* User ID
* OAuth token
* OAuth refresh token
* OAuth expiry date
  
For any member who is part of a guild with Mizar, Mizar can store (depending on guild settings configuration):
* User ID
* Guild ID
* Role IDs
* Nickname
* Number of messages sent
* Time spent in voice chat
* Experience
* Moderation actions (e.g. bans/kicks)
  * Type
  * Moderator
  * Reason
  * Time
  
For any user who logs into the website or is in a guild with Mizar, Mizar can store:
* User ID
* Tag
* Avatar URL
* User defined timezone

For any guild that Mizar is in, Mizar stores:
* Guild ID
* Name
* Owner tag
* Guild settings

## Why is it Stored?
* User IDs and guild IDs are used to track which user/guild the data is regarding.
* OAuth information is used to persist a user's authentication session between multiple individual sessions, so they do not have to keep logging in. The OAuth token itself is stored to allow for a user being logged in to the website from multiple different browsers at once.
* Role IDs and nicknames are used for user persistence if the user leaves the guild, so if the user joins again within a short timeframe their roles and nickname can be restored.
* Number of messages sent, time spent in voice chat and experience are used for ranks and the levelling leaderboard
* Moderation actions are used to keep a record of all actions taken against a user
* Tags and avatar URLs are used for the levelling leaderboard, so each user doesn't have to be manually fetched every time the leaderboard is loaded.
* Guild names and owner tags are used for the website so that users can easily see which guild they are currently viewing.

## How Long is it Stored?
* Users can be retained for up to two months depending on the guilds' individual user persistence settings
* Guilds can be retained for up to one week to allow for settings restoration if Mizar is accidently removed

## Where is it Stored?
All information is stored in a database hosted on an Amazon data centre in Ireland, which only Mizar admins have access to. These are routinely backed up.

A temporary cache of your data will be stored on the server Mizar is running on, in a data centre in the United Kingdom.

We also store essential information such as tokens in your browser as cookies and local storage.

## 3rd Parties
Mizar shares data with [Statcord](https://statcord.com) and [Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com/) to analyse usage of the bot and webpanel and make improvements.

We also use several other 3rd parties for commands (e.g. YouTube, Genius, Merriam-Webster dictionary, etc.) however the personal information sent to them is limited to the arguments you send in the commands (e.g. song name)

## Removing Your Data & Requesting More Information
> Note: you must leave all guilds with Mizar to ensure your data is not added back automatically
Please join the [support Discord server](https://mizarbot.xyz/support) if you have any queries or would like to request your data be deleted.
